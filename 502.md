## 502
Holy crap, what's going on?!?

Let me explain it to you, sometimes when a web server experience an unexpected amount of traffic all at once it sometimes can have difficulties processing a visitors request. This is not really a bad thing for me, it is just a statement that someone is actually interrested in the content I happen to produce.

Please accept my apologies for the inconveniences this might cause to you.
Try to access the site later.
